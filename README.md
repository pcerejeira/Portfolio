# Data-Analytics-Projects:
This repository was made with the aim of showing some of the projects I've been involved in, as well as the tools used and the thought process behind the solutions.

## Project 1

Covered mainly:
- Database Queries (1.5T size)
- Csv/Excel
- Json
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Languages used:
- SQL
- Python

### Goal
The objective of this project was to cross the temperature of the batteries of a vehicle (provided by Addvolt), with the ambient temperature in the place where it circulated.
Ideally, I would be able to prove in this way that the ambient temperature, even when reaching extremes (for example in the summer/winter), did not affect the efficiency of the batteries, since they did not exceed abnormal values.
